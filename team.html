                <p class="teamBio">Ade is an accounting clerk by day, but by night, they spend their spoons in pursuit of creative endeavours. Having tried just about all creative mediums they can think of, Ade proudly admits that they are a writer, specializing in dark fantasy with a special interest in body horror; a painter working with acrylics; and a drawer (if that's even a word). They might be dyslexic, but that has not stopped them from writing and roping their friends into making this zine with them.</p>
