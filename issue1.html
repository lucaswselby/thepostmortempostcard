Lights would flash up through the second story windows changing colors every ten seconds. Large droves of 20 somethings would pour in after a long day of work or classes. This Thursday is no exception.Maddyn walks in alone. She wears a plain black party dress trying to blend in with the rest of the crowd. It wasn't her first time at one of these infamous Thursday night warehouse raves; in fact, not too long ago, it was an oddity for her to miss them. She'd show up with her girls and spend the night dancing and flirting with random strangers, but it'd been a while since that.She has been avoiding coming here knowing that the all too familiar blond Alpha Phi Alpha boy would be among the party goers dancing like he had not a care in the world, and why would he have any? His father could pay off just about any problem that might arise in his path.</div>
